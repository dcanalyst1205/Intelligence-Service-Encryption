# Intelligence-Service-Encryption

Use of skills developed from learning data structures, to create an algorithm that would encrypt numbers into text. Done through the use of old phones and the numbers that correspond to each letter as a means to achieve the encryption. Text is traversed through the use of recursion and every potential variation that could be achieved with letters, given the numbers is determined and printed for the user to see.
